# RecipesAPI Frontend v2

A complete rebuild of the RecipesAPI frontend, migrating from React+Vite to Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project aims to deliver a unified, maintainable, and scalable user interface, leveraging the design system and components from the Totxo project while preserving all existing business logic and backend integrations.

## Project Goals

- Modernize the tech stack with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4
- Implement a clean, modular, and DRY architecture
- Achieve full UI consistency using shared design tokens and reusable components
- Reuse and adapt business logic (authentication, API calls, data flows) from the current production app
- Maintain seamless integration with the existing Express backend

## Features

- Unified design system based on Totxo styles and components
- Responsive layouts and mobile-first approach
- Authentication and protected routes
- Modular structure for recipes, ingredients, suppliers, events, and more
- Centralized API client and state management
- Accessibility and performance best practices

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
